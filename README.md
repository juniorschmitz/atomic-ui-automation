# Atomic UI Automation

The project has some automated UI tests implemented, the idea of the project is to show the difference between atomic UI tests and normal UI tests.

The project uses the following stack:
- Ruby language;
- Capybara gem;
- SitePrism gem;
- RSpec gem;
- Rubocop as linter;

Any doubts, feel free to contact me.
